Geocaching Tools
================

The purpose for me with this project is:

1. Learn more about web development.
2. Create useful tools that can be used by the Geocaching community.

Status
------
There is no real structure of the project yet.
The first tool that I'm developing is an app to search for Geocaches.

The frontend uses AngularJS and Bootstrap.
The backend currently uses Python (and BeautifulSoup4 for scraping) all wrapped in a bottlepy server.
